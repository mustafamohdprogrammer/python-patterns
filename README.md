Pattern Printing Python Notebook
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python codes for generating various pattern-printing problems, often encountered in programming interviews and competitive coding challenges. From simple block patterns to intricate designs with numbers, alphabets, and symbols, each example is designed to build and strengthen your fundamental programming logic.

📖 Project Description
The notebook (pattern1.ipynb) demonstrates:

Square and rectangular star/number/character patterns

Bordered and hollow patterns

Right/left-aligned triangles

Diagonal and anti-diagonal designs

Alphabet and number series

Custom ASCII art and creative shapes

The code is clean, well-commented, and suitable for absolute beginners as well as intermediate Python learners looking to master nested loops, conditional logic, and output formatting.

🗂️ Contents
Square patterns (*, $, numbers, alphabets)

Hollow and bordered squares

Diagonals and X-shaped designs

Triangles (left/right-aligned, inverted)

Pyramid and diamond patterns

Number pyramids and Pascal-like triangles

Alphabet and ASCII patterns (uppercase & lowercase)

Challenge: Custom symbols and creative figures

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pattern-printing-python.git
cd pattern-printing-python
Open the notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code (with Jupyter extension) and open pattern1.ipynb

Explore, run, experiment

Execute each cell to view output.
